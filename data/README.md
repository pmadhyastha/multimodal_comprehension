All the files are made available in the following links (https://osf.io/x7u4j/). 

Main files: 
  - Audio only files: see audio data component. Contains original EEG data, ERP data, lmer data, in zip formats.
  - Video files: see video data component. Same data structure as above.
  - Video replication files: see video replication data component. Same data structure as above.
  
Additional files: 

  - README
  - scripts: same as the code section in this GitHub page, see README in code section for descriptions
  - stimuli: experimental stimuli in audio only, video and video replication studies. In the original study by Zhang et al., 2021, participants watched/listened to the stimuli in two conditions, one with gestures and one without. Therefore, each folder contains 2 sub folders, Gesture and No Gesture. 
  - word_info: quantification of information per word. word_merged_audio_seq.csv and word_merged_replication_surprisal.csv were used in the final analysis.
